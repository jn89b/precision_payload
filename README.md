# Quantify 
- Monte Carlo simulations of the area environment
- How well do I land with bullet point dispersion 
- Different glide ratios of the payload dropped off, hold the aircraft fixed
- Need to figure out release box
# High Level Details
- Aircraft precompuates graph planner with consideration of payload to find ideal optimal payload dropoff
# To Dos
- Load in terrain information with noise?
- Astar Graph planner:
